codes for solving
nonlinear elastic equations modified on 

_classic_examples_acoustics_1d_example1 this code.

------------------------------------------

1d nonlinear system, heterogeneous csvl
f-wave is used 

After running this code and creating plots via "make .plots", you
should be able to view the plots in _plots/_PlotIndex.html.

------------------------------------------

20150226 version 0.02, physical parameters, iv and bc chosen 
as in bale2000, computational parameters should be similar,
the # of cells is 6000 which is twice the # in the paper.
wave speed seems OK however a more than 20% error in the height
is observed, do not know the reason yet

20150226 version 0.01, parameters, iv and bc chosen for no special reason
not verified yet
