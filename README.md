#The f-wave method for nonlinear conservation laws with spatially varying flux

The wave-propagation form has been shown to be a nice way to implement the finite volume method for hyperbolic conservation laws. In this project we study one generalization of the standard wave-propagation method which decomposes the flux into waves of the eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix rather than decomposing the conserved quantities. Computational experiments using the f-wave method are performed for 1D heterogeneous nonlinear elastic wave model.
